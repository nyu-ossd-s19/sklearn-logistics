# Pull Requests

## Documentation: Glossary TODOs

[Issue](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13533)
|
[PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13660)
|
[Working Branch](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/scikit-learn/tree/glossary-todo-fix)

#### Overview

The sklearn glossary of terms has a series of TODOs which need articulation.
Some sections are also completely blank, and we aim to complete those sections.
[This is the page in question.](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html)

#### Tasks Completed

* Cole Smith: Definition of Kernel method
* Grace Yang: Mutlilabel Classification Clarification
* Won Jong Yang: Density Estimation Definition
* Yuvraj Chugh: `score_samples` API function, changes according by admin suggestions
* **ON HOLD**: Dtype Precision Clarification


## Examples for Lesser-Known Estimators

[Working Branch](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/scikit-learn/tree/bagging-classifier-examples)

#### Overview

Estimators that have very specific uses, or otherwise are not often implemented,
do not have any examples of their usage, or comparison to other estimators.

We intend to add examples and comparisons to these estimators in a single Pull Request.

#### Tasks Completed

* Cole Smith: `BaggingClassifier` Example and Comparison to AdaBoost
* Grace Yang: `BaggingClassifier` Example (Code)
* Won Jong Yang: Please add what you are working on here
* Yuvraj Chugh: Trying to fix advanced installation instructions for Mac OSX users (issue created). Awaiting word on why PR is failing a cloud test
