# Sections


I think each of us should have something to say for each section of the presentation, so we can all add our own notes under the section headings, and compile them later. Don't worry about repeating thoughts, we can look into that later. 


## Why did you pick this project? 

***Yuvi:*** Popular project - used in both academia and research, amiable admins, my familiarity wuth python 

***Yang:*** Wanted to find a python based project to learn language further and machine learning is useful


## Major Contributions

***Yuvi:*** TODO comments, examples, original issues 

***Yang:*** TODO comments, error report


## What impact did your team make on the project?

***Yuvi:*** We made a good dent on documentation, and the best part is - we found our own issues. This allowed us to extract more learning and experience from OSSD. 

***Yang:*** Can't speak much as I was least accquainted with the project. But as a whole, I believe we made more contribution then expected.


## What have you learned?

***Yuvi:*** Github stuff, ethics behind OSSD, community spirit (?)

***Yang:*** review on Github branch, commits, concepts on machine learning, analysis algorithms used by sklearn

## If you could go back, would you pick sci-kit again? What did you like/dislike?

***Yuvi:*** Maybe not. I believe we underestimated how quickly issues get picked up. It was hard to find code-related issues that hadn't been picked up already. 

***Yang:*** Probably not. The project was too large and complex for me to work on a code based issues. I would like to find a different smaller project to work on If I could. 

## Problems or Challenges (challenge is a better word I guess)

***Yuvi:*** Not finding enough issues. Issues getting taken up quickly. 

***Yang:*** Not enough knowledge on my end. Finding doable issues. Understanding sklearn.

## Why we chose to focus on documentation? 

***Yuvi:*** Everyone seems to want to pick code issues. Documentation seems to be a section that goes ignored or prioritized over. We also had to create our own issues so docs were a good start.

***Yang:*** I was not ready to dive into code. Documentation was a good place for me to understand sklearn and an issue I can work on.
