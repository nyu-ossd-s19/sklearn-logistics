# Sections


I think each of us should have something to say for each section of the presentation, so we can all add our own notes under the section headings, and compile them later. 


## Why did you pick this project? 



## Major Contributions



## What impact did your team make on the project?



## What have you learned?



## If you could go back, would you pick sci-kit again?
