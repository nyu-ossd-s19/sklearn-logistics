# Sections


I think each of us should have something to say for each section of the presentation, so we can all add our own notes under the section headings, and compile them later. Don't worry about repeating thoughts, we can look into that later. 


## Why did you pick this project? 

***Yuvi:*** Popular project - used in both academia and research, amiable admins, my familiarity wuth python 


## Major Contributions

***Yuvi:*** TODO comments, examples, original issues 


## What impact did your team make on the project?

***Yuvi:*** We made a good dent on documentation, and the best part is - we found our own issues. This allowed us to extract more learning and experience from OSSD. 


## What have you learned?

***Yuvi:*** Github stuff, ethics behind OSSD, community spirit (?)


## If you could go back, would you pick sci-kit again? What did you like/dislike?

***Yuvi:*** Maybe not. I believe we underestimated how quickly issues get picked up. It was hard to find code-related issues that hadn't been picked up already. 


## Problems or Challenges (challenge is a better word I guess)

***Yuvi:*** 


## Why we picked documentation? 

***Yuvi:*** Everyone seems to want to pick code issues. Documentation seems to be a section that goes ignored or prioritized over. We also had to create our own issues so docs were a good start.
